## Description:
**LP's Auto Summon** is a mod for Terraria that enhances the summoner gameplay experience by automating the summoning of minions. With this mod, you no longer need to manually summon each minion one by one. Instead, just place your summoner weapon in the 10th hotbar slot and the mod ensures that your maximum number of minions are automatically summoned.

## How It Works:
+ **Slot 10 Detection:** The mod monitors the item in your 10th inventory slot. If it is a summoning weapon (and not a sentry), it will use this item for auto-summoning.
+ **Minion Cap Changes:** Whenever your maximum minion capacity changes (e.g., equipping new gear or buffs), the mod will automatically summon the appropriate number of minions.
+ **Player Respawn:** After respawning, the mod will ensure your minions are summoned back automatically.

## Compatibility:
**LP's Auto Summon** is compatible with most other mods. However, if you encounter any issues, please report them in the mod's comment section.
