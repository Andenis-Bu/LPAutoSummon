**LP's Auto Summon** is a mod for Terraria that enhances the summoner gameplay experience by automating the summoning of minions. With this mod, you no longer need to manually summon each minion one by one. Instead, just place your summoner weapons anywhere in the configured inventory column (10th column being the default), and the mod ensures that your maximum number of minions are automatically summoned. Additionally, the mod will automatically re-summon your minions after you respawn, ensuring you're always battle-ready.

## What's New in 1.3
- **Partial Minion Mixing:** Select an entire inventory column (1 - 10) for auto-summoning. The mod summons minions from top to bottom, summoning as many as possible from each item before moving to the next. Place single-summon or multi-slot staffs higher and regular staffs at the bottom to ensure all desired minions are summoned effectively.
- **Mute Summon Use Sounds:** Added an option to mute the sound effects when summoning minions from the configured inventory column.

## How It Works
- **Auto Summon on Item Use:** Trigger auto summon when you use your configured summoning slot item to fill in the slots.
- **Summoning Weapon Detection:** The mod constantly monitors the item in your configured hotbar slot. If the item is a summoning weapon (excluding sentries), it will automatically use this item for summoning minions.
- **Adjusts to Minion Capacity:** Whenever your maximum minion capacity changes (e.g., equipping new gear or buffs), the mod will automatically summon the appropriate number of minions.
- **Re-summon on Player Respawn:** After respawning, the mod will ensure your minions are summoned back automatically.
- **Configurable Hotbar Slot:** You can configure which hotbar slot to use for summoning, with the 10th slot being the default.
