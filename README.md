# LP's Auto Summon
**LP's Auto Summon** is a mod for Terraria that enhances the summoner gameplay experience by automating the summoning of minions. With this mod, you no longer need to manually summon each minion one by one. Instead, just place your summoner weapon in the designated hotbar slot and the mod ensures that your maximum number of minions are automatically summoned. The mod also automatically re-summons your minions after you respawn.

## What's New in 1.1
- **Configurable Hotbar Slot:** You can now configure which hotbar slot to use for summoning, with the 10th slot still being the default.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed a minor bug where summoning sounds were played for everyone in multiplayer when another player triggered their auto summoning.

## How It Works
- **Hotbar Slot Selection:** The mod monitors the item in your chosen hotbar slot. If it is a summoning weapon (and not a sentry), it will use this item for auto-summoning.
- **Adjusts to Minion Capacity:** Whenever your maximum minion capacity changes (e.g., equipping new gear or buffs), the mod will automatically summon the appropriate number of minions.
- **Player Respawn:** After respawning, the mod will ensure your minions are summoned back automatically.
